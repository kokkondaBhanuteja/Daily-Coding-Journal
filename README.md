## Problem-1 (Ninja and Locker)
   ### Statement
   ```sh
   Ninja has two arrays â€˜CASHâ€™â€™ and â€˜LOCKERâ€™ denoting the height of each stack of cash of unit width and height of â€˜Nâ€™ sections in the locker respectively.

   The locker sections are labeled from 0 to â€˜Nâ€™ - 1 from left to right.

   Cash stacks can only be put in the locker by following the certain rules:

   Cash stacks canâ€™t be piled up
   You can take any order of cash stack
   You can push the stack in the locker only from left to right
   If height of some stack is greater than the height of locker section then the stack will be stopped before that room
   Ninja wants your help to find the maximum number of cash stacks he can put into the locker.

## Problem-2
   ### Statement
   ```sh
   Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
Table: Address

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.


Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following 
information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

FirstName, LastName, City, State
   ```
